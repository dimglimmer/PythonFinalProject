# HIV 5'UTR Aligner 
---
The use of this tool will allow us to compile, cut and align sequences of the HIV 5'UTR. Furthermore we can calcualte the frequency of nucleotides in the sequence.

## Step 1

Download HIV sequences from [HIV Los Alamos Database] 
	(https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html). 
Make sure the file is in FASTA format

## Step 2

This script is reliant on the use of Bowtie2, an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. To acquire Bowtie2, (visit https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/). The contents of that directory will have to be added to your system's PATH.

```
export PATH=$PATH:/new/bowtie2

```

## Step 3

The next step of the prpject 





*Given how incredibly ambitious my original proposal design was, I have decided to start small and learn python a little better. So I have changed m project to calculating nucleotide frequencies in the 5' UTR from patients in the Los Alomos database.*
